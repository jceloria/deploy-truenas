# Choose one of the following authentication methods, "api_key" or "password" (comment out the other one).
# Auth via API keys is highly recommended, but is only available from TrueNAS (Core) 12.0 up.
# You can generate a new API key in the web interface under "Settings" (upper right) > "API Keys".
# api_key = YourNewlyGeneratedAPIKey#@#$*
# If you are on FreeNAS 11 or lower, set this to your FreeNAS root password
password = YourSuperSecurePassword#@#$*

# Everything below here is optional

# cert_fqdn specifies the FQDN used for your certificate.  Default is your system hostname
# cert_fqdn = foo.bar.baz

# connect_host specifies the hostname the script should attempt to connect to, to deploy the cert.
# Default is localhost (assuming the script is running on your FreeNAS box)
# connect_host = baz.bar.foo

# verify sets whether the script will attempt to verify the server's certificate with a HTTPS
# connection.  Set to true if you're using a HTTPS connection to a remote host.  If connect_host
# is set to localhost (or is unset), set to false.  Default is false.
# verify = false

# cert_dir_path is the directory path to the generated certificates.  Default
# assumes you're using acme.sh:
# /root/.acme.sh/cert_fqdn
# cert_dir_path = /var/etc/acme-client/home/cert_fqdn

# privkey_path is the path to the certificate private key on your system.  Default
# assumes you're using acme.sh:
# cert_dir_path/cert_fqdn.key
# privkey_path = /some/other/path

# fullchain_path is the path to the full chain (leaf cert + intermediate certs)
# on your system.  Default assumes you're using acme.sh:
# cert_dir_path/fullchain.cer
# fullchain_path = /some/other/other/path

# protocol sets the connection protocol, http or https.  Include '://' at the end.
# Default is http
# protocol = https://

# port sets the port to use to connect.  Default is 80.  If protocol is https,
# this MUST be set to your https port.
# port = 443

# set ftp_enabled to true if you have the FTP service enabled on your FreeNAS. Default is false.
# ftp_enabled = true

# set webdav_enabled to true if you have the WEBDAV service enabled on your FreeNAS. Default is false.
# webdav_enabled = true

# Certificates will be given a name with different extensions, by default it will be
# cert_fqdn.  You can change the name if you like.
# cert_base_name = letsencrypt
